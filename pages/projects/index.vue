            Lately I've found myself spending more time on this site and trying
            to figure out what I want to do with it. Should it be a place to
            host a blurb, my thoughts, a blog, or just a place for my resume to
            live?

            While not debating on what to do with this site I've been learning

            I don't have a ton of experience making games. But what I lack in
            making them I make up for in playing them and that's basically the
            same thing -- right? While learning Godot I participated in my first
            game jam:

            It's a unique (or at least we think so) take on rogue-lites where
            time is your health. As time ticks away, the music gets faster and
            the enemies get harder. Collecting power from enemies rewinds time
            and allows you to upgrade or swap out weapons to help you stay
            alive.

            Unnamed Blacksmithing Game

          <p class="mb-2">
            I've always been enamoured with the art of blacksmithing. In every
            game I play it's the first profression I take and max first. While I
            don't quite have the offline chops of a real smith I figured I'd
            turn the love into something a bit more accessible.

            Currently, there isn't
            <span class="font-semibold italic">much</span> of a game to show
            off. But, the grand plan is a collection of fun mini-games centered
            around the management of your very own blacksmith shop. I do have
            one or two mini-games complete (proofs of concept really) at the
            moment with more to come!
