            Lately I've found myself spending more time on this site and trying
            to figure out what I want to do with it. Should it be a place to
            host a blurb, my thoughts, a blog, or just a place for my resume to
            live?

            While not debating on what to do with this site I've been learning

            I don't have a ton of experience making games. But what I lack in
            making them I make up for in playing them and that's basically the
            same thing -- right?

            This was my first attempt at a functional game and not only that it
            had to be done in three days or less. Spin to Begin was submitted as

            game jam. I didn't tackle this alone, though. I joined a team
            consisting of myself and the brotherly duo

          <p class="mb-2">
            It was an awesome learning experience and extremely fun to be a part
            of a team making the game. I am already looking for more game jams
            to enter into!

            If you are wondering which weapon is the best: It's the shotgun
            which was designed by yours truly.

          <p class="mb-2">
            <span class="font-semibold">Spin to Begin</span> is a unique (or at
            least we think so) take on rogue-lites where time is your health. As
            time ticks away, the music gets faster and the enemies get tougher.

            Picking up batteries replinishes lost time and allows you to choose
            from one of seven weapons and five different upgrade options.

            Unnamed Blacksmithing Game
          </p>

          <p class="mb-2">
            I've always been enamoured with the art of blacksmithing. In every
            game I play it's the first profession I take and max first. While I
            don't quite have the offline chops of a real smith I figured I'd
            turn the love into something a bit more accessible.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-2">
            Currently, there isn't
            <span class="font-semibold italic">much</span> of a game to show
            off. But, the grand plan is a collection of fun mini-games centered
            around the management of your very own blacksmith shop. I do have
            one or two mini-games complete (proofs of concept really) at the
            moment with more to come!
