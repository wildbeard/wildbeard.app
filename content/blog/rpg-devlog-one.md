### Game Design Document
The Game Design Document (GDD) is the on paper proof of concept of your game. It will house things like your ideas, game systems, mechanics, and your target audience. It's a home for describing the unique selling points of your game and in what genre it will live. If you can't describe on paper *why* your game would be fun why would it be fun for a player behind a screen?

I'd like to re-iterate that I am not a professional game developer. This is the first game I am taking the time to create a GDD. Which is what I would say if I hadn't already started programming before writing anything in the GDD. What little code I did write before starting the GDD wasn't substantial. If I remember correctly it was just generating a turn order and letting it play.

### What's in a GDD
The GDD will contain everything that describes [what]{.italic.text-logo} the game is, [who]{.italic.text-logo} it is for, [why]{.italic.text-logo} it could be fun, and [how]{.italic.text-logo} it will be played or how it will make money. You could argue that the [what]{.text-logo} and the [who]{.text-logo} could be a single category so let's combine them for simplicities sake. The GDD should describe, in some length, the ins-and-outs of your game, the aesthetic, music, how it plays, how it feels, why people would want to play it, and why it is unique.

Keep in mind this is an ever evolving document. Nothing you write is set in stone. Now that I think about it, the GDD is basically a Product Manager's dream come true.

### What and Why
The [What]{.text-logo} is going to give your game a name, a brief concept, and the genre you're targeting. Coming up with the concept and genre might be the easiest part in this section. 

* The Concept: Describes, briefly, [what]{.text-logo} the game is. Sum it up in pre-Elon "I paid for more characters" Tweet length.
* The Genre: Is basically [what]{.text-logo} niche your game belongs to. Think of words like "RPG", "Roguelite", or "MMORPG".
* The Title: [What]{.text-logo} your game will be called. Unless you're making a game *from* a title, your title is like going to be "Untitled Cool Game" or "Robert's RPG" until *something* just clicks. 

The [Why]{.text-logo} is why would this appeal to anyone? Being unique should not be confused with being original. There are hundreds of high fantansty RPGs with witches, wizards, and knights but that doesn't mean you should halt immediate progress on your game. So [why]{.text-logo} should someone play this game? What about your witches, wizards, and knights is fun or different? Do you have gnomes who are otherwise regularly proportioned despite the fact they have 6ft legs?

### Who and How
The [Who]{.text-logo} and the [How]{.text-logo} is a bit messy. It mixes a part of the identity from the [what]{.text-logo} with how you want to accomplish your concept.

* Your Audience: [Who]{.text-logo} is the player or who is this game for? Are your large gnomes going to appeal to them? If so why? Who am I kidding. Who doesn't like extremely tall gnomes?
* Your World: [Who]{.text-logo} lives in your world and [how]{.text-logo} do your players interact with them? Is your world rich with story or a mindless button mash? Do you have main characters or is the player stealing the show?
* Core Gameplay: [How]{.text-logo} is this game going to be played? Is it 2D or 3D? Action RPG or Turn Based? Are you at the mercy of the RNG Gods or is there a linear loot path?
* Making Money: [How]{.text-logo} do you want to do that? The answer is don't make money. Money is a crutch.
