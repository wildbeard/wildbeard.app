### Preface
Well, well, well, what do we have here? A video game & a blog post? It sounds like someone might have been recently let go from their job. If we're being honest I think being let go the reason most software devs turned indie devs get started. Don't quote me on that though as I did *absolutely* no research to substantiate that claim.

It is true though, I did get let go on April Fool's Day. Imagine trying to explain that to friends and family on the "prank day." Regardless, we're here now so let's get **[Devlog 000]{.text-logo}** started.

### The Idea
All games, good or bad, start with an idea and that's how this one started. However, it was not my idea for this game. I was talking with a friend, we'll call them "Robert", about my recent tinkerings with a few little games using the <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot</a> game engine. In chatting, "Robert" asked if I wanted to use one of their ideas for a game. 

**The Idea**: a 2D turn based RPG where loot, skills, and the game world are randomized.

After buying the sales pitch I said "Sure, why not? It can't be ***that hard*** right?"

You foolish, foolish boy.

### Godot
I had thought about using Unity but after the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23873852/unity-new-pricing-model-news-updates" target="_blank">shit storm</a> Unity caused for itself I decided against it. Obviously, there are any number of other options like Godot, Unreal, RPGMaker, and the list goes on. But, I settled with Godot because it is free, open source, community driven, lightweight, and it is (to my novice eyes) performant and capable. If you're interested in seeing some of the games made with Godot checkout <a href="https://godotengine.org/showcase/" target="_blank">Godot's showcase</a>. If you're on Reddit, the <a href="https://reddit.com/r/godot" target="_blank">Godot subreddit</a> is very active with showcases, demos, and helpful people. It's even being considered by the <a href="https://caseyyano.com/on-evaluating-godot-b35ea86e8cf4" target="_blank">Slay the Spire devs</a>. Their writeup can explain the pros/cons of the engine better than I can so give it a read.

Now, my choice might have been biased as I've tinkered with Godot for a little while now. What started with following a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAbG8Oi-SvQ&list=PL9FzW-m48fn2SlrW0KoLT4n5egNdX-W9a" target="_blank">good tutorial</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@uheartbeast/videos" target="_blank">Heartbeast</a> has lead me to making a small game myself, and to participating in a <a href="https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-157-electric/results" target="_blank">Game Jam</a> with a small team. Not to brag, but our game, <a href="https://indigosingularity.itch.io/spintobegin" target="_blank">Spin to Begin</a>, came 7<sup>th</sup> overall and 2<sup>nd</sup> in usage of the limitation. Outside of the tutorial, the game jam, and a side project (since abandoned; it wasn't fun), that's about where my experience ends with Godot.

### Making Things Difficult
There are so many <a href="https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset" target="_blank">Godot Plugins</a>. They range from asset management, pre-built movement systems, to visual heightmap editors. There are even entire game templates for RPGs! Yes, you read that right -- I can get an off the shelf RPG and kickstart my development. While I want "Robert's" game to come to life, and plugins would make it easiy, I've decided not to use any.

Why am I not using any of these plugins? This might be a naive take but: this is a learning experience, and while I can simplify the process with plugins that's necessarily helping me learn in the grand scheme of things. I ***don't know how*** to make games so I want to ***learn to do it***. I want to experience the pitfalls of the weird systems I've come up with and how to fix them. I want to tailor how the item and spell system works to my liking. I want to ***break*** things. I want my math to be so egregiously incorrect that I one shot a goblin just by looking at him. I want to make mistakes and learn from them.

### Outro
I'll do my best to keep writing about the progress of "Robert's RPG". I can't promise anything, though. I am not much of a writer and I rewrote this post about as many times as I'm going to rewrite "Robet's RPG". Maybe I'll try and write about other things like cars and finding a job.
