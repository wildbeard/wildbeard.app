### A Brief Introduction
Who am I? Hi, my name is Press and it is nice to meet you. I am software developer and have been for close to 10 years. I've spent most of my career writing HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP to build websites. These skills make me fully qualified to stop building websites and start making games. After all, what is a video game if not an extremely complicated website?

I am by no means a matter expert in game development, programming in general, turn based games, or RPGs. Take everything you read from here on out with a *heavy* pinch of salt. The idea is to start writing about how this game started, log what is happening, and hold myself accountable for making progress. I will admit my follow-through and writing skills are notoriously bad so keep that in mind.

### The Why
A friend, we'll call them "Robert", approached me and asked if I wanted a game idea they had. There was a lot of back and forth on Discord about how the game would be played, how skills would work, are there classes, how equipment was obtained, so on so on.
After the sales pitch I thought: "Sure, why not? I don't have a job and this doesn't sound ***that hard*** to make."

### The What
"Robert's" idea: a Rouge-lite RPG that randomizes encounters, dungeons, skills, and equipment. You know, the standard Rouge-lite mechanics. There's no core gameplay loop, setting, story, or cool characters in this game. There is only RNGesus. But this can all be smoothed out in a TBD fashion.

### The How
Since I already have *some* experience building a game (yes, singular) with Godot I decided it was my best option. I have followed some tutorials on creating simple games in the past, but <a href="https://indigosingularity.itch.io/spintobegin" target="_blank">Spin to Begin: Upgrade &amp; Survive</a> was the first game I helped build from scratch. And, might I add, it is quite addicting for as little time we spent on it.

### The When

There is no timeline and progress is at the whim of my free time and laziness. The progress I have made has been steady and there hasn't been any major setbacks. Although, there was one *minor* setback: "Robert" deleted all of the files in the repo. But, hey, like I said nothing major and that's what friends are for. Also, version control. Always use version control.

That's all I have for today. Come back next time for more poorly thought out brain dumps. :)
